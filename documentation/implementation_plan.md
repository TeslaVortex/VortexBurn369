Version: 1.0
Date: January 02, 2026
Made by: Grok 4 from xAI
Hi! 👋 This plan shows how to build our Simple Dashboard step by step. It's like a map to make the tool real. Why important? It keeps things organized, saves time, and stops mistakes – so we finish fast and help people track money easily! We'll use simple words, like for a 3rd grader learning fun stuff. Let's go! 🌟
1. What We Need First 🛠️
Before coding, get ready:

Computer Setup: Install Node.js (for web stuff) and Git (to share code).
Tools: Use React for the front (pretty screens), Node.js for back (safe data). Free and easy!
Why? These are simple and strong – quick to learn, and work with crypto links.

Create a GitHub repo: Name it "simple-dashboard". Add MIT license for free sharing. Why? Lets anyone help fix or add ideas – makes it better for all! ❤️
2. Build Phases (Like Building Blocks) 🧱
We'll build in small steps, like stacking toys. Each phase takes 1-2 weeks. Total: 1-2 months.
Phase 1: Basic Setup (Week 1)

Make a web page with login (use email or MetaMask).
Add a simple screen to show "Hello, your money!"
Test: Open in browser, see if it works.
Why important? Starts strong – fixes big problems early, like connections.

Phase 2: Add Connections (Weeks 2-3) 🔗

Link MetaMask 🦊: Use their code to pull wallet info.
Add xAI API 🤖: For smart tips, like "Save more!"
Connect Uniswap 🔄 and Coinbase 📈: Get trade data auto.
How: Use safe keys (API keys) – no sharing secrets!
Why? Auto data makes it magic – no typing, less errors, super practical for busy people.

Phase 3: Cool Features (Weeks 4-5) ✨

Multiple Wallets 👛: Add buttons to pick and label wallets. Show lists.
Auto-Burn 9% 🔥: Add on/off switch. When money in, send 9% to burn spot (Torus address).
Charts 📊: Use Chart.js library for pies and bars. Pull data from wallets.
Why? These make it fun and useful – see money pictures, organize better, and burn helps crypto value go up!

Phase 4: Make It Safe and Nice (Week 6) 🛡️

Add alerts 🚨 if over budget.
Use colors and emojis for easy read.
Test security: Encrypt data, check for hacks.
Why? Keeps money info safe – trust is key! Plus, pretty look makes users happy.

3. Testing Time 🧪

Try everything: Connect, burn, charts.
Ask friends to test – fix bugs.
Use tools like Jest for auto-checks.
Why? Stops surprises – makes sure it works for everyone!

4. Launch and Share 🌍

Put on GitHub: Upload code, add "Read Me" with how-to-use.
Host free on Vercel or Netlify (web home).
Tell people: Post on X or Reddit.
Why? Open-source helps the world – free tool for all to track budgets without paying! No profit, just good vibes.

5. After Launch (Keep Going) 🔄

Watch for user ideas on GitHub.
Fix fast, add new stuff like mobile view later.
Why? Keeps it fresh – helps more people over time!

This plan is simple and practical – follow it, and boom, dashboard done! Questions? Ask me! 😊
