## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Install Everything

**Frontend** (the website part):
```bash
cd frontend/personal-dashboard
npm install
```

**Backend** (the server part):
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Why?** This downloads all the tools the app needs to work!

### Step 2: Set Up Secrets

Copy the example file:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and add your API keys (optional - app works without them!)

**Why?** Keeps your secret keys safe and never shared!

### Step 3: Run It!

**Start Backend** (in one terminal):
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Opens on: `http://localhost:5000` ✅

**Start Frontend** (in another terminal):
```bash
cd frontend/personal-dashboard
npm start
```
Opens on: `http://localhost:3000` ✅

**Why two terminals?** The backend is the brain (handles data), frontend is the face (what you see)!

## 🔐 Safety First

✅ **Never share your `.env` file** - It has secret keys!  
✅ **Test burns on testnet first** - Real burns can't be undone!  
✅ **Confirm before burning** - App always asks "Are you sure?"  
✅ **Watch-only wallets are safe** - They can't spend your money  

**Why important?** Keeps your crypto safe from hackers and mistakes!
